# Progressive Web Apps

It's been said that the next frontier of web development is creating web apps that are more powerful, faster to load and use, and more accessible and responsive.  These are only a few the enhanced features of mobile development that make **progressive web apps** exciting.

## Prerequisites

-   Basic knowledge of web development and some app development
-   A mobile device that runs the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/mobile/)
-   HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Describe what a progressive web app (a/k/a PWA) is.
-   Identify characteristics and benefits of PWAs.
-   Use terminology to describe PWA development tools and technologies: manifest, service workers, and application shell architecture.
-   Rewrite objecives that begin with "Use" by inverting sentence structure.
-   End each objective with a period.
-   Write objectives on the whiteboard so they can be referenced during a talk.

## Preparation

1.  Fork and clone this repository TODO add link
2.  Open a 2nd browser window in [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwo4jOBRBmEiwABWNaMVaLRHvNRYZcUmAFh33hX-8NuSekPEYlVcL0HNOM6SC-9MRUgSTYYxoC-coQAvD_BwE&dclid=CLHHtZfWtdYCFcZGNwod7TMG8A)

## Leading Topic Heading

Here is where the talk begins. If you have not already included framing above,
it's appropriate to put it here. Link to introductory articles or documentation.
Motivate the next section.

Demos, exercises, and labs are labelled as such, followed by a colon and a
description of the activity starting with an [imperative
verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood).

## Demo

In your Chrome browser, copy and paste the following text into your url


Demos correspond to the "I do" portion of scaffolding from consultant training.

## Code-Along: Write an Code-Along

![Characteristics of a PWA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tPwQxTv7I9w8iOsl1 "Characteristics of a PWA")


## Lab: Write a Lab

During labs, developers get to demonstrate their understanding of concepts from
demos and applied knowledge from exercises. Labs are an opportunity for
developers to build confidence, and also serve as a diagnostic tool for
consultants to evaluate developer understanding.

Labs should be timed explicitly using a timer. When estimating the time it will
take to complete a lab, it is better to overestimate. During labs, consultants
should circle the room and interact with developers, noting patterns and
prompting with hints on how to complete the lab. If developers end early, a
consultant may stop the lab timer. If developers do not finish in time, a
consultant may give more time at her discretion based on current talk pace, the
current estimate for the talk, and the importance of completing the lab while
consultant support is available.

Labs correspond to the "You do" portion of scaffolding from consultant
training.
