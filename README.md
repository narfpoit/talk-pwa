# Progressive Web Apps

It's been said that the next frontier of web development is creating web apps that are more powerful, faster to load, faster to use, and more accessible and responsive.  Enter **progressive web apps (a/k/a PWAs)**.
What I previously described are only a few of the enhanced features of web development that make progressive web apps exciting.

## Prerequisites

-   Basic knowledge of web development and mobile app development
-   A mobile device that runs the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/mobile/)
-   HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Describe what a progressive web app (a/k/a PWA) is.
-   Identify characteristics and benefits of PWAs.
-   Use terminology to describe PWA development tools and technologies: manifest, service workers, and application shell architecture.

## Preparation

1.  Fork and clone this repository
2.  Open a 2nd browser window in [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwo4jOBRBmEiwABWNaMVaLRHvNRYZcUmAFh33hX-8NuSekPEYlVcL0HNOM6SC-9MRUgSTYYxoC-coQAvD_BwE&dclid=CLHHtZfWtdYCFcZGNwod7TMG8A)

## What is a Progressive Web App?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app), Progressive Web App(s):

> is a term used to denote web applications that use the latest web technologies.

> are also known as Installable Web Apps or Hybrid Web Apps

> are regular web pages or websites, but can appear to the user like traditional applications or native mobile applications. The application type attempts to combine features offered by most modern browsers with the benefits of mobile experience.

What does this mean, exactly?  Allow me to show you...

## Follow-Along

In your Chrome browser, copy and paste the following text into your url bar:

```chrome://flags/#enable-add-to-shelf```

In the highlighted section, select "Enabled" in the drop down menu. Then, do the same for the following link:

```chrome://flags/#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks```

## Technologies

To develop PWAs, there is a set of commonly used components, or technologies, used:

### Manifest

### Service Workers

### Application Shell Structure


These technologies make PWAs distinctive in that they enable the following combination of characteristics to set them apart from what we commonly know as downloadable native apps and other standard web sites which require a fast internet connection to function optimally in your browser.

The current leading champion of PWAs is  Google.  It was designer Frances Berriman and Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell who coined the term "Progressive Web Apps" and according to Google developers, the distinctive characteristics of PWS are:

>**Progressive** - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice because they’re built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.

>**Responsive** - Fit any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or forms yet to emerge.

>**Connectivity independent** - Service workers allow work offline, or on low quality networks.

>**App-like** - Feel like an app to the user with app-style interactions and navigation.

>**Fresh** - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.

>**Safe** - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn’t been tampered with.

>**Discoverable** - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.

>**Re-engageable** - Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.

>**Installable** - Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.

>**Linkable** - Easily shared via a URL and do not require complex installation.

## Lab: Write a Lab

During labs, developers get to demonstrate their understanding of concepts from
demos and applied knowledge from exercises. Labs are an opportunity for
developers to build confidence, and also serve as a diagnostic tool for
consultants to evaluate developer understanding.

Labs should be timed explicitly using a timer. When estimating the time it will
take to complete a lab, it is better to overestimate. During labs, consultants
should circle the room and interact with developers, noting patterns and
prompting with hints on how to complete the lab. If developers end early, a
consultant may stop the lab timer. If developers do not finish in time, a
consultant may give more time at her discretion based on current talk pace, the
current estimate for the talk, and the importance of completing the lab while
consultant support is available.

Labs correspond to the "You do" portion of scaffolding from consultant
training.
